Routine Description:

  Record runtime information to a buffer.

Arguments:

  ResultBuffer      - Buffer space.
  ResultBufferSize  - Result buffer size in octets.
  Format            - Format string.
  ...               - Variables.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS - Operation succeeded.
  EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES - Memory allocation failed.
