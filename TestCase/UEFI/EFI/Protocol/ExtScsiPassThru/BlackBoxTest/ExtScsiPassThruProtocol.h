  Routine Description:
    Sends a SCSI Request Packet to a SCSI device that is attached to the SCSI channel. This function   
    supports both blocking I/O and nonblocking I/O. The blocking I/O functionality is required, and the
    nonblocking I/O functionality is optional.                                                             
  
  Arguments:
    This   - A pointer to the EFI_EXT_SCSI_PASS_THRU_PROTOCOL instance.
    Target - The Target is an array of size TARGET_MAX_BYTES and it represents
             the id of the SCSI device to send the SCSI Request Packet. Each
             transport driver may chose to utilize a subset of this size to suit the needs
             of transport target representation. For example, a Fibre Channel driver
             may use only 8 bytes (WWN) to represent an FC target.
    Lun    - The LUN of the SCSI device to send the SCSI Request Packet.
    Packet - A pointer to the SCSI Request Packet to send to the SCSI device
             specified by Target and Lun.
    Event  - If nonblocking I/O is not supported then Event is ignored, and blocking
             I/O is performed. If Event is NULL, then blocking I/O is performed. If
             Event is not NULL and non blocking I/O is supported, then
             nonblocking I/O is performed, and Event will be signaled when the
             SCSI Request Packet completes.

  Returns:
    EFI_SUCCESS          - The SCSI Request Packet was sent by the host. For bi-directional
                           commands, InTransferLength bytes were transferred from
                           InDataBuffer. For write and bi-directional commands,
                           OutTransferLength bytes were transferred by
                           OutDataBuffer.
    EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE  - The SCSI Request Packet was not executed. The number of bytes that
                           could be transferred is returned in InTransferLength. For write
                           and bi-directional commands, OutTransferLength bytes were
                           transferred by OutDataBuffer.
    EFI_NOT_READY        - The SCSI Request Packet could not be sent because there are too many
                           SCSI Request Packets already queued. The caller may retry again later.
    EFI_DEVICE_ERROR     - A device error occurred while attempting to send the SCSI Request
                           Packet.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER- Target, Lun, or the contents of ScsiRequestPacket are invalid.
    EFI_UNSUPPORTED      - The command described by the SCSI Request Packet is not supported
                           by the host adapter. This includes the case of Bi-directional SCSI
                           commands not supported by the implementation. The SCSI Request
                           Packet was not sent, so no additional status information is available.
    EFI_TIMEOUT          - A timeout occurred while waiting for the SCSI Request Packet to execute.

              channel. On output, a pointer to the LUN of the next SCSI device present
              on a SCSI channel.
  
  Returns:

                            channel was returned in Target and Lun.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - Target array is not all 0xF, and Target and Lun were

  Routine Description:

  Arguments:
    This       - A pointer to the EFI_EXT_SCSI_PASS_THRU_PROTOCOL instance.
    Target     - The Target is an array of size TARGET_MAX_BYTES and it specifies the
                 Target ID of the SCSI device for which a device path node is to be
                 allocated and built. Transport drivers may chose to utilize a subset of

    DevicePath - A pointer to a single device path node that describes the SCSI device
                 specified by Target and Lun. This function is responsible for
