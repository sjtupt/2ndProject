  Routine Description:
    Allows the user to set controller specific options for a controller that a
    driver is currently managing.

  Arguments:
    This             - A pointer to the EFI_DRIVER_CONFIGURATION_ PROTOCOL instance.
    ControllerHandle - The handle of the controller to set options on.
    ChildHandle      - The handle of the child controller to set options on.  This
                       is an optional parameter that may be NULL.  It will be NULL
                       for device drivers, and for a bus drivers that wish to set
                       options for the bus controller.  It will not be NULL for a
                       bus driver that wishes to set options for one of its child
                       controllers.
    Language         - A pointer to a three character ISO 639-2 language identifier.
                       This is the language of the user interface that should be
                       presented to the user, and it must match one of the languages
                       specified in SupportedLanguages.  The number of languages
                       supported by a driver is up to the driver writer.
    ActionRequired   - A pointer to the action that the calling agent is required
                       to perform when this function returns.  See "Related
                       Definitions" for a list of the actions that the calling
                       agent is required to perform prior to accessing
                       ControllerHandle again.

  Returns:
    EFI_SUCCESS           - The driver specified by This successfully set the
                            configuration options for the controller specified
                            by ControllerHandle..
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - ControllerHandle is not a valid EFI_HANDLE.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - ChildHandle is not NULL and it is not a valid EFI_HANDLE.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - ActionRequired is NULL.
    EFI_UNSUPPORTED       - The driver specified by This does not support setting
                            configuration options for the controller specified by
                            ControllerHandle and ChildHandle.
    EFI_UNSUPPORTED       - The driver specified by This does not support the
                            language specified by Language.
    EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      - A device error occurred while attempt to set the
                            configuration options for the controller specified
                            by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle.
    EFI_OUT_RESOURCES     - There are not enough resources available to set the
                            configuration options for the controller specified
                            by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle.
