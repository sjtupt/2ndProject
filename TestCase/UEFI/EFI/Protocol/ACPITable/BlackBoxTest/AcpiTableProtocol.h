  Routine Description:
    Installs an ACPI table into the RSDT/XSDT.

  Arguments:
    This                  - Protocol instance pointer.
    AcpiTableBuffer       - A pointer to a buffer containing the ACPI table to be installed.
    AcpiTableBufferSize   - Specifies the size, in bytes, of the AcpiTableBuffer buffer.
    TableKey              - Reurns a key to refer to the ACPI table.

  Returns:
    EFI_SUCCESS           - The table was successfully inserted.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - Either AcpiTableBuffer is NULL, TableKey is NULL, or AcpiTableBufferSize 
                            and the size field embedded in the ACPI table pointed to by AcpiTableBuffer
                            are not in sync.
    EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  - Insufficient resources exist to complete the request.
