  Routine Description:
    Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the EFI Driver.

  Arguments:
    This       - A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.
    Language   - A pointer to a three character ISO 639-2 language identifier.
                 This is the language of the driver name that that the caller
                 is requesting, and it must match one of the languages specified
                 in SupportedLanguages.  The number of languages supported by a
                 driver is up to the driver writer.
    DriverName - A pointer to the Unicode string to return.  This Unicode string
                 is the name of the driver specified by This in the language
                 specified by Language.

  Returns:
    EFI_SUCCES            - The Unicode string for the Driver specified by This
                            and the language specified by Language was returned
                            in DriverName.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - Language is NULL.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - DriverName is NULL.
    EFI_UNSUPPORTED       - The driver specified by This does not support the
                            language specified by Language.

  Routine Description:
    Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller
    that is being managed by an EFI Driver.

  Arguments:
    This             - A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.
    ControllerHandle - The handle of a controller that the driver specified by
                       This is managing.  This handle specifies the controller
                       whose name is to be returned.
    ChildHandle      - The handle of the child controller to retrieve the name
                       of.  This is an optional parameter that may be NULL.  It
                       will be NULL for device drivers.  It will also be NULL
                       for a bus drivers that wish to retrieve the name of the
                       bus controller.  It will not be NULL for a bus driver
                       that wishes to retrieve the name of a child controller.
    Language         - A pointer to a three character ISO 639-2 language
                       identifier.  This is the language of the controller name
                       that that the caller is requesting, and it must match one
                       of the languages specified in SupportedLanguages.  The
                       number of languages supported by a driver is up to the
                       driver writer.
    ControllerName   - A pointer to the Unicode string to return.  This Unicode
                       string is the name of the controller specified by
                       ControllerHandle and ChildHandle in the language specified
                       by Language from the point of view of the driver specified
                       by This.

  Returns:
    EFI_SUCCESS           - The Unicode string for the user readable name in the
                            language specified by Language for the driver
                            specified by This was returned in DriverName.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - ControllerHandle is not a valid EFI_HANDLE.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - ChildHandle is not NULL and it is not a valid EFI_HANDLE.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - Language is NULL.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - ControllerName is NULL.
    EFI_UNSUPPORTED       - The driver specified by This is not currently managing
                            the controller specified by ControllerHandle and
                            ChildHandle.
    EFI_UNSUPPORTED       - The driver specified by This does not support the
                            language specified by Language.
