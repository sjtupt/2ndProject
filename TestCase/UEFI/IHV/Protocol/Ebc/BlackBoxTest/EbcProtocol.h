Abstract:

  Describes the protocol interface to the EBC interpreter.

Routine Description:

  Create a thunk for an image entry point. In short, given the physical address
  of the entry point for a loaded image, create a thunk that does some
  fixup of arguments (and perform any other necessary overhead) and then
  calls the original entry point. The caller can then use the returned pointer
  to the created thunk as the new entry point to image.

Arguments:

  This          - protocol instance pointer
  ImageHandle   - handle to the image. The EBC interpreter may use this to keep
                  track of any resource allocations performed in loading and
                  executing the image.
  EbcEntryPoint - the entry point for the image (as defined in the file header)
  Thunk         - pointer to thunk pointer where the address of the created
                  thunk is returned.

Returns:

  Standard EFI_STATUS

/*++

Routine Description:

  Perform any cleanup necessary when an image is unloaded. Basically it gives
  the EBC interpreter the chance to free up any resources allocated during
  load and execution of an EBC image.

Arguments:

  This          - protocol instance pointer
  ImageHandle   - the handle of the image being unloaded.

Returns:

  Standard EFI_STATUS.

/*++

Routine Description:

  The I-Cache-flush registration service takes a pointer to a function to
  call to flush the I-Cache. Here's the prototype for that function pointer.

Arguments:

  Start         - physical start address of CPU instruction cache to flush.
  Length        - how many bytes to flush of the instruction cache.

Returns:

  Standard EFI_STATUS.

/*++

Routine Description:

  This routine is called by the core firmware to provide the EBC driver with
  a function to call to flush the CPU's instruction cache following creation
  of a thunk. It is not required.

Arguments:

  This      - protocol instance pointer
  Flush     - pointer to the function to call to flush the CPU instruction
              cache.

Returns:

  Standard EFI_STATUS.

/*++

Routine Description:

  This routine can be called to get the VM revision. It returns the same
  value as the EBC BREAK 1 instruction returns.

Arguments:

  This      - protocol instance pointer
  Version   - pointer to where to return the VM version

Returns:

  Standard EFI_STATUS.
