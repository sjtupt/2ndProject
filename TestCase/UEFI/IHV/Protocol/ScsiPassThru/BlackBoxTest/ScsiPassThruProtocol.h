  Routine Description:
    Sends a SCSI Request Packet to a SCSI device that is attached to
    the SCSI channel. This function supports both blocking I/O and
    non-blocking I/O.  The blocking I/O functionality is required,
    and the non-blocking I/O functionality is optional.

  Arguments:
    This                  - Protocol instance pointer.
    Target                - The Target ID of the SCSI device to
                            send the SCSI Request Packet.
    Lun                   - The LUN of the SCSI device to send the
                            SCSI Request Packet.
    Packet                - A pointer to the SCSI Request Packet to send
                            to the SCSI device specified by Target and Lun.
    Event                 - If non-blocking I/O is not supported then Event
                            is ignored, and blocking I/O is performed.
                            If Event is NULL, then blocking I/O is performed.
                            If Event is not NULL and non blocking I/O is
                            supported, then non-blocking I/O is performed,
                            and Event will be signaled when the SCSI Request
                            Packet completes

  Returns:
    EFI_SUCCESSThe        - SCSI Request Packet was sent by the host, and
                            TransferLength bytes were transferred to/from
                            DataBuffer.See HostAdapterStatus, TargetStatus,
                            SenseDataLength,and SenseData in that order
                            for additional status information.
    EFI_WARN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  - The SCSI Request Packet was executed, but the
                            entire DataBuffer could not be transferred.
                            The actual number of bytes transferred is returned
                            in TransferLength. See HostAdapterStatus,
                            TargetStatus, SenseDataLength, and SenseData in
                            that order for additional status information.
    EFI_NOT_READY          - The SCSI Request Packet could not be sent because
                            there are too many SCSI Request Packets already
                            queued.  The caller may retry again later.
    EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      - A device error occurred while attempting to send
                            the SCSI Request Packet. See HostAdapterStatus,
                            TargetStatus, SenseDataLength, and SenseData in
                            that order for additional status information.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  - Target, Lun, or the contents of ScsiRequestPacket
                            are invalid. The SCSI Request Packet was not sent,
                            so no additional status information is available.
    EFI_UNSUPPORTED        - The command described by the SCSI Request Packet
                            is not supported by the host adapter. The SCSI
                            Request Packet was not sent, so no additional
                            status information is available.
    EFI_TIMEOUT            - A timeout occurred while waiting for the SCSI
                            Request Packet to execute. See HostAdapterStatus,
                            TargetStatus, SenseDataLength, and SenseData in
                            that order for additional status information.
